import PropertyTable from '../../components/propertyTable';
import schema from '../../../../api/components/icon.schema.json';



All of the possible values for the icon come from the [material design icons](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/Icons-class.html#constants).

## Examples

`value` just represent the id of the material design icons you want to use, check the doc to find one that fit your needs.

### Simple icon

```json
{
    "type": "icon",
    "value": "abc"
}
```

### Icon color & size
You can also change the font color just for your icon, try by changing the `integer` code of this icon.

(In this example, the hexadecimal code uses a syntactic sugar from JavaScript but the value sent is still an Integer)

```json
{
    "type": "icon",
    "value": "abc",
    "color": 0xFF000000,
    "size": 100
}
```
