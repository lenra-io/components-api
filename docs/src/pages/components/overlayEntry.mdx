# {schema.title}

This component is used to create an **overlay** that shows itself over the current application's UI. For example, it might be interesting to use it when displaying errors in a snackbar.

## Examples

### Simple overlayEntry

This component uses the `showOverlay` boolean property to know whether it should be shown to the screen or not. This property **should be used** to open/close the overlayEntry. The overlayEntry **should not be** directly removed from the JSON tree as it will not follow the right disposing process, the overlayEntry will end up stuck on the screen with no way to remove it.

```json
{
    "type": "overlayEntry",
    "showOverlay": true,
    "child": {
        "type": "text",
        "value": "This text is shown inside of an overlayEntry."
    }
}
```

### Recommended : Overlays in root component
It is recommended to put overlays inside the root `flex` component of the application because it will be easier to handle the lifecycle of these overlays. Behind the scenes, the overlays are put at the top of the UI tree anyway. An example is shown below.

```json
{
    "type": "flex",
    "children": [
        {
            "type": "text",
            "value": "This is the main UI of the app",
        },
        // Add overlays in root flex component.
        {
            "type": "overlayEntry",
            "showOverlay": true,
            "child": {
                "type": "text",
                "value": "This text is shown inside of an overlayEntry."
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

<PropertyTable schema={schema}/>
