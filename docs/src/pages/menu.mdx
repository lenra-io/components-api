# Menu

This component is meant to be used along with the `menuItem` component because there is no real interest of using it alone.
 
## Examples

### Simple menu
You can handle your app menu by mixing `menu` and `menuItem` in your app, but you can also place any types of components in your `menu`.

```json
{
    "type": "menu",
    "children": [
        {
            "type": "text", 
            "value": "Child"
        }
    ]
}
```

<PropertyTable schema={menuSchema}/>
