# {schema.title}

This component makes its child actionable based on the defined properties.

When stacking two or more actionables of the same size and using the same attribute, only the lowest one in the tree will be called.

## Examples

### Making a text clickable

The actionable component will allow you to set an event listener on many user actions.

You can set the `onPressed` event using the following example to trigger the action `textPress`.
`props` will add more flexibility and allow reusable listeners by passing some more informations to your listeners like the `id` of the button you pressed.

```json
{
    "type": "actionable",
    "onPressed": {
        "action": "textPress",
        "props": {
            ...
        }
    },
    "child": {
        "type": "text",
        "value": "This is an actionable text."
    }
}
```

### Handling multiple events.

You can handle multiple events using just one `actionable`.
Just define them in the component declaration like in this example :
```json
{
    "type": "actionable",
    "onPressed": {
        "action": "pressedOnceAction",
    },
    "onDoublePressed": {
        "action": "doublePressedAction",
    },
    "onLongPressed": {
        "action": "longPressedAction",
    },
    "onHovered": {
        "action": "hoveredAction",
    },
    "child": {
        "type": "text",
        "value": "This is an actionable text."
    }
}
```

### Stacking actionables with same attribute.

You can stack `actionable` that trigger the same event, but only the deepest actionable will trigger the action.

Deeper your `actionable` is, more priority it gets to trigger the event.


```json
{
    "type": "actionable",
    "onPressed": {
        // Will not be called because there is an actionable below that defines the onPressed attribute
        // Note that if this actionable was sized to be bigger than the actionable below, it would be possible to trigger this onPressed
        "action": "willNotBeCalled",
    },
    "onDoublePressed": {
        // Will be called because there is no actionable below that defines this attribute
        "action": "willBeCalled",
    },
    "child": {
        "type": "actionable",
        "onPressed": {
            "action": "willBeCalled",
        },
        "child": {
            "type": "text",
            "value": "This is an actionable text."
        }
    }
}
```

<PropertyTable schema={schema}/>
